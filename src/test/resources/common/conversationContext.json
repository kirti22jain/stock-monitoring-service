The weather in Goa during May is hot and humid, with temperatures ranging from 30 to 35 degrees Celsius (86 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit). Additionally, May is the beginning of the monsoon season in Goa, so there is a possibility of heavy rainfall. \n\nIf you prefer cooler weather and want to enjoy outdoor activities and the beaches, it is recommended to visit Goa during the winter months (November to February) when the weather is pleasant. However, if you don't mind the heat and are looking for a budget-friendly trip, you can still visit Goa in May. Just be prepared for the hot weather and occasional rain showers."

May marks the beginning of summer in Shimla, and the weather is pleasant with temperatures ranging from 15 to 25 degrees Celsius (59 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit). It is a great time to escape the heat of the plains and enjoy the cool mountain climate of Shimla.\n\nIn May, you can explore the scenic beauty of Shimla, go for nature walks, visit the famous Mall Road, and enjoy outdoor activities like trekking and horse riding. The weather is ideal for exploring the surrounding areas and enjoying the breathtaking views of the Himalayas.\n\nJust keep in mind that May is a popular tourist season in Shimla, so it can get crowded. It is advisable to make your travel and accommodation arrangements in advance."
